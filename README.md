# powers and quizPowers

Powers prints out a table of powers
for the integers 2,m with exponents 2,n
- see how many you can memorize!

According to the introduction in Leonard Euler's "Elements of Algebra"
(ISBN-13: 978-1508901181), Euler had the powers up to six memorized for all numbers from 1, 100.
I'll give him that he probably had the powers for 101 memorized too
(since the digits are from Pascal's Triangle so easy to remember).
See the file "table.euler" included in this repo that list of numbers.

Try "powers -h" and make yourself some tables to look over. I've uploaded the output
from running the program with various options for some interesting cases.
See the files "table.?digits".

Maybe start small and work up to what Euler had accomplished.
I have all two digit powers memorized and am pretty good with all 
all three digit powers. 

Use the program 'quizPowers' to test yourself! Run it and type 'help' - it's pretty raw
as it stands, but has potential to be a fun app. Anyway, it works and
can save your progress so you can pick up where you left off. It tries to quiz you 
repeatedly on answers you missed to help you remember them.
