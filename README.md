# powers
Fun table to print out the powers 2..n of ints 2...m - see how much you can memorize! According to the introduction in Leonard Euler's "Elements of Algebra", Euler had the powers up to six memorized for all numbers from 1, 100. I'll give him that he probably had 101 memorized too, as it's a gimme, the digits are from Pascal's Triangle. Try "powers" out and see for yourself!
