# powers
Fun table to print out the powers from 2,n for the integers 2,m - see how many you can memorize! According to the introduction in Leonard Euler's "Elements of Algebra" (ISBN-13: 978-1508901181), Euler had the powers up to six memorized for all numbers from 1, 100. I'll give him that he probably had the powers for 101 memorized too, as it's a gimme, the digits are from Pascal's Triangle. Try "powers" out and see for yourself. I've also uploaded the output from running the program with various options for some intersting cases.  Maybe we can start small and work our way up to what Euler had accomplished.  I have all two digit powers memorized.  Can I do all three digit powers?
